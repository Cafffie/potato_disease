Potato Disease Detection Project


Overview

This web application is designed to identify diseases present in potato plants based on uploaded images of potato plant leaves. It leverages deep learning models to analyze the images and provide predictions with confidence levels for potato diseases.

Features

- Upload Interface: Allows users to upload images (JPG, PNG, JPEG) of potato plant leaves.
- Prediction: Provides real-time predictions of potato diseases detected in the uploaded images.
- Confidence Level: Displays the confidence level (in percentage) for each prediction.

Usage

To use the Potato Disease Detection App:

1. Upload Image: Drag and drop your image file directly into the designated area on the app interface.
2. View Prediction: Once the image is uploaded, the app will process it and display the predicted disease along with the confidence level.
3. Interpret Results: Use the prediction and confidence level to assess the health of your potato plants and take appropriate actions.

Technologies Used
